# project3-TeamMagnificence

SPRINT 1:

SCRUM meeting 1 - 03/24/2025
The team discussed the implementation of the system and decided against using React and to just use pure javascript html and css. The team also decided that the cashier interface should be changed to be more time efficient rather than initially intuitive.

SCRUM meeting 2 - 03/26/2025
The team decided to pivot to using React after all, since the realization was made that implementing the interface in React would be easier, even though the learning curve is higher initially. Therefore, everyone needs to learn React before the next meeting. Additionally, as the team learns React they will begin their assigned implementation tasks.

SCRUM meeting 3 - 03/31/2025
The team discussed the current MVP and all work that was completed/partially completed. The MVP was decided to be the initial Manager view, as the Cashier/Customer views were not polished enough to publish. The team delegated and planned the completion of written elements for sprint 1.

SPRINT 2:

SCRUM meeting 4 - 4/2/2025
We talked about what our other persona would be for our project.  We are leaning towards Steven.  We talked about how we would implement our touchscreen for the customer view of our system.  We are going with Carol for our persona.  We are going to implement within CSS a way to increment the font size by some number to increase or decrease the font size if need be.  We then talked about adding API stuff to the github issues tab.  This being the weather, authentication, and translation.  For user authentication, only the managers and cashiers would use this, not the customer.  When we get to the customer page, there will be an option to sign in which changes the UI to be either a cashier or a manager page based on the sign in that we provide.  We have also copy and pasted the API links for weather, user authentication, and translation to the github for ease of access.  We then talked about our implementation of our API systems.  We came to the conclusion that this will be simple API calls in the frontend, but are not sure whether we could run into problems or not.  We talked about adding a table to our database that keeps track of the different user logins.  As for our status updates, we learned how to use React better and are becoming more familiar with the software we are using.  We have not completed anything fully yet.  Before the next meeting, we plan on finishing written documentation, finishing the presentation for the mid project assignment, and we have created a structured way that we will go about completing sprint 2, learning from our mistakes in sprint 1.

SCRUM meeting 5 - 4/7/2025 
We talked about each of our status updates as well as what we are working on next.  Daniel worked with the weather api and got it to work over the weekend.  His next step is to update the item menu on the manager side or add a button to change between the cashier and manager tabs.  Janik cleaned up the file structure within our github repos.  We now have 4 separate files and 4 separate “views” on the site.  We have a login, which is the root of our website, and customer, cashier, and manager tabs.  You can either go into the order page as a customer or login using a login. Depending on the user information used during login, you will be sent to either the cashier and manager pages.  Janik will start working on the authentication api.  John will finish cashier functionality, finish the kiosk item modification functionality, and add the categories on the kiosk.  Jackson will start implementing the resize button to change the size of the text in our interface for easy readability, will start working with the implementation of the frontend design ideas, and will start working on transaction and order processing functionality .  Overall, we will now begin the bulk of our remaining work so that we have most of sprint 3 to debug and touch up our interface.

SCRUM meeting 6 - 4/9/25 
Janik has been working on the login page.  Authentication with google identification is done.  He is now working on the user confirmation for the employee identification to talk to the backend. Janik plans to have this done by today or tomorrow.  Daniel worked on the Z report.  He was able to get the button to show on the manager tab.  He is troubleshooting the backend because it is not pulling all the info.  If he gets that done, he will work on inventory updating.  John has got the pop up for the menu item modification sorted, just needs to touch up.  He is going to start working on the translation api and working on the cashier page.  Jackson is working on the script for the font size changing and will finish by this weekend.  He will then start working on the order processing.
